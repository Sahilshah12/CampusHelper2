### Issue: "Task :app:compileDebugKotlin FAILED"
**Solution:** Check Logcat for specific error, usually missing import

### Issue: "NetworkOnMainThreadException"
**Solution:** Should not occur (we use coroutines), but check repository implementations

### Issue: "401 Unauthorized"
**Solution:** Token expired, logout and login again

### Issue: "Unable to resolve host"
**Solution:** Backend not running or wrong URL in Constants.kt
